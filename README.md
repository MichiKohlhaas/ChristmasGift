## What is this?
A video game I made for the /egg/ (Euro Gun General) Sekret Santa. Goal was to make a game in a week. 
Did not turn out too successfully because of issues that took *way* too long to solve. As of now the game is "playable", with 2 levels that loop around.

### What's Planned?
Currently, the game is not at the state that I want it to be. Here is a list of planned features:

- Save & load system
- Opening cutscene
- 5 complete levels, one for each of the worst cities in Belgium
- More enemy types
- Adding bosses
- Improved enemy AI
- Keybinding option screen
- BGM
- Music volume control
- Changing the character sprite to have Belgian camo
- Maybe include a game mode where you fly a plane (Nice to have, out of scope currently)

### What is the game about?
The exact story is still being developed, but the general idea is that you are a Belgian who has had enough of the EU and decides to get his revenge on the Belgian and EU politicians in Brussels. Each boss at the end of the level is going to be a EU/Belgian politician but it is revealed that they are actually aliens.
